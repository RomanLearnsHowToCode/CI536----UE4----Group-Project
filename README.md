**Project Proposal**: “**Planit Party**” – an *educational* console, and/or desktop (non-mobile), co-operative multiplayer party game exploring the *environmental* consequences of \[competitive\] *human behaviour*.

\[**...**\]

**Project Goal**:

This project’s aim is to develop an *educational* console, and/or desktop (non-mobile), co-operative multiplayer party game for groups of two to four participants, targeted at audiences 12+ years of age; exploring the *environmental consequences* of \[competitive\] *human behaviour*, with an emphasis on teaching the notion of “*cause and effect*” through degradation of the audial and visual presentation.

\[**...**\]

Throughout development, adhere to the following guidelines:

- Educate players on numerous environmental issues, including, but not restricted to *climate change*, *endangered species*, *environmental degradation*, *pollution*, and *resource depletion*.
- Encourage the co-operation of participants through *positive* and/or *negative reinforcement* – i.e. additional rewards for the participants that use the least amount of resources, relatively.
- Present players with relative feedback directly correlating in-game actions to real-world issues.
